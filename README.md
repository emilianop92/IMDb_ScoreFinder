# IMDb_ScoreFinder
Looks for movie titles in a website, then searches for the movie's IMDb score.

The Master file takes in a URL for an article with the Netflix recommendations, calls the IMDb_ScoreFinder function, and returns a dataframe of the recommended movies sorted by the highest IMDb score.

NOTE: Use of this script requires an OMDb API key. OMDb provides these keys for free. To make the script work, insert the key into the IMDb_ScoreFinder file.
